# PortfolioWebsite

I would like to finish the projects section by adding in all the remaining projects and their descriptions. I would also like to add in buttons in the bottom right of each div that allows for the container to expand and show a longer description/more pictures of the designs. For written reports, the expanded div would show an embedded pdf. I would also like to add a link to the respective github repositories for each project and a general link to my github at the bottom of the site. Finally I want to fix the text and image sizing so it is adaptive to the size of the webpage.
