# PortfolioWebsite

I plan to update this site so that all of the separate sections have their content organized in columns and rows that adjust based on the window size. For the skills section I would like to make collapsible boxes for each specific skill. For the project section I would like to turn the list of categories into a button bar that allows the user to select specific categories of projects to view. For instance, selecting mechanical design would show my CAD work and fabrication projects, such as Vibrance or MediReady. Selecting Chemical Engineering would show my papers designing a plant or analyzing heat exchangers. I would like to provide GitHub links to applicable projects on my portfolio as well. I want to add a constant nav bar at the top as well that allows the user to jump between sections.
