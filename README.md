# PortfolioWebsite

My site is intended as a professional portfolio that showcases the various projects I've worked on through studying mechanical and chemical engineering with a minor in computer science. I want to show the variety of skills I've honed and teams I've worked with. To improve the site in the futute I would like to add a link to the respective github repositories for each project and a general link to my github at the bottom of the site. Finally I want to fix the text and image sizing so it is adaptive to the size of the webpage.
